### A Small Demo of a Music Catalog Centered on Listener-Art(ist) Connections

The final project will include a tool to help users catalog the music in their library. As a universal database for music, the tool will use the open-source MusicBrainz database. Users will be able to create collections of their musical objects, which can range from the typical streaming format (i.e. a collection of songs) to a collection of albums, labels, recording studios and anything else.
