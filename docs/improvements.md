### How To Make It Better

- Art is **human** - help facilitate the social aspect of discovery more, and stop replacing human connection with algorithms
- **Explainability** - why is something worth listening to? Cater to lean-in listeners
- **Transparency** in promoted recommendations - mandate notices, disincentivize a race to bottom
- **Artistic** **control** - let artists have more freedom in the presentation of their work to listeners
- **Listener control** - give users more ability to catalogue, annotate, and own their music taste
- **Competition** - make it easier to compete with established streaming giants
