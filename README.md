# Losing Musical Connection in the Streaming Era

## A miniature project demo

This repository hosts a small static Jekyll site at [mini.milkcrate.cc](https://mini.milkcrate.cc). The ultimate goal 
of this project is a much larger website, including prominent dynamic content like interactive explanations of 
recommendation system algorithms. However, this "mini" site serves as an outline of the final site, illustrates some 
of its key points, and aims to demonstrate the potential value of a website-based exposition of my research this
summer.
