Welcome to the miniature, work-in-progress version of my website! While the final product will be a dynamic website with significantly more content, interactive demos explaining prevalent music discovery algorithms, and more, this site is a bare-bones outline of the final product.

This site also aims to demonstrate the potential value of a website-based exposition of my research this summer.

The website's principal components will be the following listed pages. Their "miniature" versions on this site (linked below) are brief explanations of the topics they will eventually cover.

1. [How Does Music Discovery Work?](/discovery)
2. [Impacts on Music and Culture](/impacts)
3. [Why It Matters](/why)
4. [How To Make It Better](/improvements)
5. [A Pilot Program](/pilot)

This site is named in recognition of the once-traditional repurposing of milk crates to store vinyl records, in addition to pretty much anything else. (Stealing milk crates for other purposes was so common that Pennsylvania passed a law prohbiting their use for anything but milk!). The ".cc" extension (top level domain) is often used in association with Creative Commons projects, making it a good fit for a project focused on demystifying the black box of music recommendation systems and their effects.

My contact info is linked at the bottom of this page â€“ reach out if you have any questions, comments, or ideas!
